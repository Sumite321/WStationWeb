# WeatherDB

WeatherDB acronym for Weather Database is fully inspired by my passion for Meteorology. I decided to independently learn C++ with help of tutorials and thought of building my skills by creating this database.
Currently a simple database like program that will realize the following operations:
<ul>
<li> Input data 
<li> Read data
<li> Calculate mean
<li> Duplicated data
</ul>
All data is stored in a txt file with the following format - ddmmyearlowhighhum.

The database will check for existent data before writing to the txt file. For instance, if the txt file already has already data for 15/02 and tries to add data to the same day, the program will throw an error displaying that data already exists for the particular day. 

<b>Future features will include:</b>
<ul>
<li> Modify data
<li> Remove data
<li> Filter data(show the low/high for a specific day)
</ul>
<b> Advanced future features will include</b>
<ul>
<li> Automated day detector
<li> Intelligent data insertion
<li> Potential link to a Weather Station
<li> Produce PDF reports
<li> Chance for a GUI
</ul>
